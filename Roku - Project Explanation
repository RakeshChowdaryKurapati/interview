Actually I was the part of a developement team

BrightScript is the primary programming language used for developing

I used eclipse as the IDE with the necessary plugins 

In my project I used Scenegraph framework  for building the user interface like structure of screens, components, and navigation

XML is commonly used to define the structure and layout of screens and components within SceneGraph framework

XML is the markup language used to describe the hierarchical structure of screens, dialogs, and components 

It contains Components and parent and child nodes

component named "Main" that extends the "Scene" component, which is the base for building Roku interfaces.

BrightScript script associated with the "Main" component. It links to the "Main.brs" file located in the directory.

after we need to put container It will have child nodes

For example we need two buttons like submit and Reset under a label

we need to create Group node . It is be the child node for the main scene

Under the groub node we can describe two button tags with the id of the button , text, height and width and translation

These attributes will be associated with the event handler function which is defined in bright script file

In the bright script file we need to write the code for the  event handlers

In the images folder we will maintain the logos , splash images and other artwork

I am using git for as the version control. we can track the changes

On requirement basis I used to push the code into the git hub
