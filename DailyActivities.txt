So, in my project

We are following agile model...

I used to involve in ceramonies like Scrum meeting, sprint planning , spring review , sprint retrospective and backlog refinement meetings
 
 
 After the sprint planning team lead used to plan for stories distribution..
 
  After discussing with the team in the scrum I used to create the subtasks like TestCasedesign, functionaltesting, test review and inline automation
  for stories which are aligned to me.
  
  In the phase of development i used to analyse the story and prepare test cases based on the acceptance criteria
  
  If there is any doubts in the story I will collaberate with the developers or Scrum master to get it clear
  
  once the story moved to ready for QA.. I would execute the test cases and if I found any bugs then I will report in Jira with the 
  steps to reproduce and attach the screeshots
  
  In Parlelly I develope the automation scripts which are the tests can be automated
  
  Once the bug fix done I will retest it and execute the automation script 
  If the test results got as expected I will move it into Ready for Acceptance and I will give the demo in the stand up call
  
 
these activities i would involve on daily basis
