As a Junior Roku Developer I mainly involved in learning and contributing to Roku channel development, 
and growing my skills in Roku development

My primary focus is to continue learning and expanding my knowledge of Roku development.

I worked closely with senior developers and team members to contribute to Roku channel development project. 
Like assisting in creating and maintaining user interfaces, implementing features, and collaborating on content integration.

While working closely with senior developers, I wrote BrightScript code for specific functionalities within the channel.

I assist in integrating and managing content within the channel, 
and learning how to organize content efficiently to meet project requirements.

While learning, I was assist in addressing user inquiries and issues, 
ensuring a positive user experience by responding to the feedback and concerns.

I used to take the bug fixes like cosmetic bugs and low priority bugs which are aligned

I used to prepare sprint metrics and send to the project manager like no.of stories we done in the sprint and no.of spill over stories and bug fixes
