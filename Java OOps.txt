Java oops

In the interview and programming point  of you oops concept is important

Oops have 4 principle

Inheritance 

polimorphism

Encapsulation 

abstraction

If any language having these principles those programming languages can be OOP language

For Declaring primitive data types we are not creating any objectcs

In java there are static key concept --- Static methods can be called without creating an object, and they can operate on non-static members

By these characteristics java is not 100 percent oop

But 95% of the charcters are similar to oop language

Thats why we are calling Java is an object oriented programming
